            <p>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
            The Latest, The Next Full Moon is a Supermoon and a Blue Moon
            The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.
            Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our solar system.
            Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.
            NASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon â€“ Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft (not to be confused with NASA's new Artemis program to send astronauts back to the Moon).
            <br><br>
            The lunar surface is covered in impact craters and is marked, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of cooled magma. These maria formed when large impacts on the far side of the Moon heated up low lying layers of its crust on the near side. The Moon is, beside when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] <br><br>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits around Earth at an average distance of 384400 km (238900 mi; 1.28 ls), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. The Moon faces Earth always with its near side by having a rotation period that equals its orbital period, resulting from being tidally locked to Earth. This period is in relation to the Sun 29.5 days long and visible as the cycle of the lunar phases. For Earth, the Moon has been aside from the Sun the most influential celestial object, particularly with its gravitational influence it has been the main driver of Earth's tides.
            <br><br>
            The Moon's mass, density and surface gravity of about one-sixth of Earth's (at 0.1654 g), are rivaled among Solar System satellites only by Jupiter's moon Io. It is a satellite planet in geophysical terms and among all planetary-mass objects of the Solar System larger and more massive than all of its known dwarf planets.[17] Its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), which is roughly one-quarter that of Earth or about the width of Australia,[18] making it by far the largest and most massive satellite in the Solar System in relation to its parent planet and the fifth-largest Solar System satellite overall. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.
